This is a handy Adobe AIR app,
nice for playing some chiptune in
its native formats (.MOD, .XM, and others).
It's very basic and raw for now. It was
built for my personal use at first. One
thing I really like about it is that it
allows to quickly place a track into
your library from an URL, which is more
convenient than hobbling through Windows
Explorer windows or such.
